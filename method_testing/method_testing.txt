Assignment: Method Testing
Previously, we showed how to test getter and setter for attributes in our class. In this assignment, you will be testing both attributes and public methods. For example, to test the elevator_pitch method from our Project class, update your RSpec file to the following:

/project/project_spec.rb
require_relative 'project'
RSpec.describe Project do
  before(:each) do
    # updated this block to create two projects
    @project1 = Project.new('Project 1', 'description 1')
    @project2 = Project.new('Project 2', 'description 2')
  end
  ... 
    # Code from the previous tab removed for brevity. Leave it in.
  ...
  it 'has a method elevator_pitch to explain name and description' do
    expect(@project1.elevator_pitch).to eq("Project 1, description 1")
    expect(@project2.elevator_pitch).to eq("Project 2, description 2")
  end
end

Run the test and we should get 0 failures!

In your Project class, do the following:
- Add a new owner attribute and allow it to be set to a string upon initialization (eg. Project.new("Project 1", "description 1", "John Doe")

- Add a new tasks attribute and initialize it to be empty array.

- Add a tasks method that returns the tasks for each project

- Add an add_tasks method that pushes a single tasks to the tasks attribute

- Write a test for the owner attribute. It should have a getter and a setter.

- Write a test for the tasks and add_tasks methods

Advanced Challenge:
- Add a new method called print_tasks that will print each task in your project

- Write a test for the print_tasks method
